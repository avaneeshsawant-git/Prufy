# Prufy 🟢  
### Proof of Work • Tasks • Focus

**Prufy** is a proof-of-work–driven task manager that focuses not just on *what* you plan to do, but on the **work you actually put in**.

Inspired by systems like Google Classroom, Prufy brings accountability, clarity, and focus to personal productivity.
